Wires store two points of information:
⦁	Their energy (int/double, in J)
⦁	"Check" status (byte)
⦁	0 = not checked
⦁	1 = checked
⦁	2 = need to check
⦁	3 = inert

A-Check
Energy starts from a generator, which checks every second to see if it has enough energy to
theoretically do anything(<= 50J). If it does, it checks each BlockFace to see if there is
technology. Each wire that this finds gets energy and has its "check" status set to 2 (need to
check). (If there is a machine connected, it just gives energy directly to it.) This happens for
each wire connected to the generator, or until the generator runs out.

B-Check
Each second, another check will run, this time for all wires set to a "check" status of 2 (need
to check). This performs the same check as a generator, checking each BlockFace for
technology. If it finds a machine, it will give energy to the machine and move on, if it hasn't
run out of energy. If it finds a wire with a "check" status of 0 (not checked), it transfers the
correct amount of energy and sets that wire's "check" status to 2 (need to check). When all
checks are run, the "parent" wire is set to a "check" status of 1 (checked) and the process repeats.

C-Check
Another check runs after this, those of wires of "check" status 1 (checked) and 3 (inert). First,
all wires of "check" status 3 are set to "check" status 0 (not checked). Then, it goes through to
see if any wires of "check" status 2 are next to it. If there are any, set it to "check" status 3
(inert); it's still important for the next C-check. If none are present, however, the wire's
"check" status is set to 0 (not checked), since the wire currently has nothing to feed into it,
and thus has no reason to be having "check" status 1.
